These are my notes from the conference.  Feel free to add any notes you've taken or correct mine if I captured something incorrectly.  I don't claim ownership of any of the content from the talks.

Also, anything that you find emphasized with italics, bolding, or both, was emphasized by the speaker, or by me.  I might have found something potentially noteworthy during the talk but that might not have been the speaker's intention.
